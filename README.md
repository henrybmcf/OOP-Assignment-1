Object Orientated Programming Assignment. Nov-Dec 2015.

Project visualising data from the Tour de France (TdF).
TdF data taken from 1947 - 2015. Various data found across multiple sites used to create a single csv file.

Data includes:
- Length of tour
- Number of stages
- Winner of tour (yellow jersey)
- Average speed (of winner).

More data to be added (pending discovery of sources), such as:
- All jersey places (Green, White & Polka dot)
- Number of categorised climbs
- Total ascent
- Podium finishers
- Record holders - Most wins, most jerseys, most tours, etc.

Graphs/Visualisation to be used:
Length - Line trend graph.
Stages - Pie graph.
Speed - Trend graph.
Record Holders - Bubble graph.
Ascent - Mountain graph.

Menu to be visualised as bicycle wheel, with each section between spokes as a menu option.
Menu option to select each data individually. 1 - Length, 2 - Stages, etc.
Other menu options to show two or more sets of data, i.e. 9 - Select option
	Sub-menu to select data. 1 - Length, etc.
	Both data options selected will show on the same graph for comparison
Sub-menus within all to show mean, mode, etc.
Possible induction of correlation graphs, Length & speed, etc.

Websites used:
- http://bikeraceinfo.com/tdf/tdfstats.html
- http://www.letour.fr/HISTO/us/TDF/index.html

Possibility for advanced features:
- Visualise geotagged data on a map -> Show race routes for each year
- Use a Kinect or Leap Motion to interact with the visualisation using gestures -> Use motion to select menu option from wheel.
